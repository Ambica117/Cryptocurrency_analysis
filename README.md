The primary goal of this project was to fetch live cryptocurrency data for the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, perform basic analysis, and display the data in a live-updating Google Sheets document. The analysis aimed to provide insights into the market trends, including identifying the top cryptocurrencies, calculating average prices, and analysing the highest and lowest price changes over the last 24 hours.
